1. What problem are we solving?
People who are looking for more films, TV shows, and music that matches their interests.

2. What blockers do you have?
Authenticating our desired API key. We have a back up, GraceNote, if that proves to not be possible.

3. What is the MVP?
The user is able to enter their preferences based on our criteria and we provide the user with educated options of new content to consume. Getting the user's preferences could be in the form of a quiz.
